## Description
It's a program capable of calculating student grades, detecting the speed of a car and calculating someone's net salary.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Description: This program prompts the user to input a student's mark, which should be between 0 and 100. Based on the input mark, the program calculates and outputs the corresponding grade using the following grading scale:

A: > 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 50 to 59
D: 40 to 49
E: less than 40

Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Description: This program takes as input the speed of a car. If the speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it prints "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program prints "License suspended".

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Description: This program calculates an individual's net salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary using predefined tax rates and deduction percentages provided by the Kenyan Revenue Authority (KRA).
